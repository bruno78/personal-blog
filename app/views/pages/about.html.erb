        Not too long ago, I decided to embark on an old dream: to become a programmer. It's been a very exciting journey playing with code, creating sites and analyzing data.
        I've also had great oportunity to work using Super 8 and old film cameras. On my free time, I enjoy learning new programming skills, cooking, playing my instruments and taking photos.
